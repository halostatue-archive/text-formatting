Text::Format 1.0.0
==================
Text::Format is provides the ability to nicely format fixed-width text with
knowledge of the writeable space (number of columns), margins, and indentation
settings. Text::Format can work with either TeX::Hyphen or Text::Hyphen to
hyphenate words when formatting.

This is release 1.0, containing both feature enhancements and bug fixes over
the previous version, 0.64.

Text::Format is originally based on the Perl library of the same name by Gábor
Egressy. It is copyright 2002 - 2005 by Austin Ziegler and is licenced under
Ruby's licence. It is also available under the Perl Artistic licence.
