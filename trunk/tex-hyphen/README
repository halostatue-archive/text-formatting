TeX::Hyphen 0.4.0
Copyright © 2003 - 2004 Martin DeMello and Austin Ziegler

Hyphenates a word according to a TeX pattern file (defaults to Donald E.
Knuth's hyphen.tex, included in this distribution). This is a straightforward
port of the perl implementation by Jan Pazdziora
[http://search.cpan.org/author/JANPAZ/TeX-Hyphen-0.140/lib/TeX/Hyphen.pm].
Because hyphenation can potentially be an expensive proposition, TeX::Hyphen
will now return from a cache.

TeX::Hyphen is licensed under the same terms as Ruby or under the GPL version
2, or later.

This is the last version of TeX::Hyphen.
