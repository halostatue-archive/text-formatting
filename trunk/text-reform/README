Text::Reform README
===================

Text::Reform class is a rewrite from the Perl module with the same name by
Damian Conway (damian@conway.org). Much of this documentation has been copied
from the original documentation and adapted to the Ruby version.

The interface is subject to change, since it will undergo major Rubyfication;
additionally, some features may have not been ported yet.
