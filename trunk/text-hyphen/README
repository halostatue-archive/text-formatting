Text::Hyphen README
===================
Text::Hyphen will properly hyphenate various words according to the
rules of the language the word is written in. The algorithm is based on
that of the TeX typesetting system by Donald E. Knuth. This is based on
the Perl implementation of TeX::Hyphen[1] and the Ruby port[2]. The
language hyphenation pattern files are based on the sources available
from CTAN[3] as of 2004.12.19 and have been translated by Austin
Ziegler.

This release is 1.0.1. It is a minor bugfix for the RubyGem release of
Text::Hyphen to enable the hyphen command-line program. Text::Hyphen
represents a significant improvement over its predecessor, TeX::Hyphen.

    require 'text/hyphen'
    hh = Text::Hyphen.new(:language => 'en_us', :left => 2, :right => 2)
      # Defaults to the above
    hh = TeX::Hyphen.new
    
    word = "representation"
    points = hyp.hyphenate(word)  #=> [3, 5, 8, 10]
    puts hyp.visualize(word)      #=> rep-re-sen-ta-tion

Text::Hyphen is truly multilingual[4]. As an example, consider the
difference between the following:

    require 'text/hyphen'
      # Using left and right minimum values of 0 ensures that you will
      # see all possible hyphenation points, not just those that meet
      # the minimum width requirements.
    en = Text::Hyphen.new(:left => 0, :right => 0)
    fr = Text::Hyphen.new(:language = "fr", :left => 0, :right => 0)

    puts en.visualise("organiser")      #=> or-gan-iser
    puts fr.visualise("organiser")      #=> or-ga-ni-ser

As you can see, the hyphenation is distinct between the two hyphenators.
Additional improvements over TeX::Hyphen include thread safety (except
for debug control) and support for UTF-8.

The licensing for Text::Hyphen is complex and somewhat dependent upon
the languages being used during hyphenation; some languages are held
under a more strict licence than that granted in the LICENCE file.
