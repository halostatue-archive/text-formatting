  # = Introduction
  #
  # Text::Reform class is a rewrite from the perl module with the same name
  # by Damian Conway (damian@conway.org). Much of this documentation has
  # been copied from the original documentation and adapted to the Ruby
  # version.
  #
  # The interface is subject to change, since it will undergo major
  # Rubyfication.
  #
  # = Synopsis
  #   require 'text/reform'
  #   f = Text::Reform.new
  #
  #   puts f.format(template, data)
  #
  # = Description
  # == The Reform#format method
  #
  # Reform#format takes a series of format (or "picture") strings followed
  # by replacement values, interpolates those values into each picture
  # string, and returns the result.
  #
  # A picture string consists of sequences of the following characters:
  # [<]                   Left-justified field indicator. A series of two or
  #                       more sequential +<+'s specify a left-justified
  #                       field to be filled by a subsequent value. A single
  #                       +<+ is formatted as the literal character '<'.
  # [>]                   Right-justified field indicator. A series of two
  #                       or more sequential >'s specify a right-justified
  #                       field to be filled by a subsequent value. A single
  #                       < is formatted as the literal character '<'.
  # [<<>>]                Fully-justified field indicator. Field may be of
  #                       any width, and brackets need not balance, but
  #                       there must be at least 2 '<' and 2 '>'.
  # [^]                   Centre-justified field indicator. A series of two
  #                       or more sequential ^'s specify a centred field to
  #                       be filled by a subsequent value. A single ^ is
  #                       formatted as the literal character '<'.
  # [>>.<<<<]             A numerically formatted field with the specified
  #                       number of digits to either side of the decimal
  #                       place. See _Numerical formatting_ below.
  # [[]                   Left-justified block field indicator. Just like a
  #                       < field, except it repeats as required on
  #                       subsequent lines. See below. A single [ is
  #                       formatted as the literal character '['.
  # []]                   Right-justified block field indicator. Just like a
  #                       > field, except it repeats as required on
  #                       subsequent lines. See below. A single ] is
  #                       formatted as the literal character ']'.
  # [[[]]]                Fully-justified block field indicator. Just like a
  #                       <<<>>> field, except it repeats as required on
  #                       subsequent lines. See below. Field may be of any
  #                       width, and brackets need not balance, but there
  #                       must be at least 2 '[' and 2 ']'.
  # [|]                   Centre-justified block field indicator. Just like
  #                       a ^ field, except it repeats as required on
  #                       subsequent lines. See below. A single | is
  #                       formatted as the literal character '|'.
  # []]].[[[[]            A numerically formatted block field with the
  #                       specified number of digits to either side of the
  #                       decimal place. Just like a +>>>.<<<<+ field,
  #                       except it repeats as required on subsequent lines.
  #                       See below.
  # [~]                   A one-character wide block field.
  # [\]                   Literal escape of next character (e.g. +\+ is
  #                       formatted as '~', not a one character wide block
  #                       field).
  # [Any other character] That literal character.
  #
  # Any substitution value which is +nil+ (either explicitly so, or because
  # it is missing) is replaced by an empty string.
  #
  # == Controlling Reform instance options
  # There are several ways to influence options set in the Reform instance:
  #
  # 1. At creation:
  #       # using a hash
  #     r1 = Text::Reform.new(:squeeze => true)
  #
  #       # using a block
  #     r2 = Text::Reform.new do |rf|
  #       rf.squeeze = true
  #       rf.fill    = true
  #     end
  #
  # 2. Using accessors:
  #     r         = Text::Reform.new
  #     r.squeeze = true
  #     r.fill    = true
  #
  # The Perl way of interleaving option changes with picture strings and
  # data is currently *NOT* supported.
  #
  # == Controlling line filling
  # #squeeze replaces sequences of spaces or tabs to be replaced with a
  # single space; #fill removes newlines from the input. To minimize all
  # whitespace, you need to specify both options. Hence:
  #
  #   format  = "EG> [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[["
  #   data    = "h  e\t l lo\nworld\t\t\t\t\t"
  #   r         = Text::Reform.new
  #   r.squeeze = false # default, implied
  #   r.fill    = false # default, implied
  #   puts r.format(format, data)
  #     # all whitespace preserved:
  #     #
  #     # EG> h  e        l lo
  #     # EG> world
  #
  #   r.squeeze = true
  #   r.fill    = false # default, implied
  #   puts r.format(format, data)
  #     # only newlines preserved
  #     #
  #     # EG> h e l lo
  #     # EG> world
  #
  #   r.squeeze = false # default, implied
  #   r.fill    = true
  #   puts r.format(format, data)
  #     # only spaces/tabs preserved:
  #     #
  #     # EG> h  e        l lo world
  #
  #   r.fill    = true
  #   r.squeeze = true
  #   puts r.format(format, data)
  #     # no whitespace preserved:
  #     #
  #     # EG> h e l lo world
  #
  # Whether or not filling or squeezing is in effect, #format can also be
  # directed to trim any extra whitespace from the end of each line it
  # formats, using the #trim option. If this option is specified with a
  # +true+ value, every line returned by #format will automatically have the
  # substitution +.gsub!(/[ \t]+/, '')+ applied to it.
  #
  #   r.format("[[[[[[[[[[[", 'short').length # => 11
  #   r.trim = true
  #   r.format("[[[[[[[[[[[", 'short').length # => 6
  #
  # It is also possible to control the character used to fill lines that are
  # too short, using the #filler option. If this option is specified the
  # value of the #filler flag is used as the fill string, rather than the
  # default +" "+.
  #
  # For example:
  #   r.filler = '*'
  #   print r.format("Pay bearer: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^", '$123.4')
  # prints:
  #   Pay bearer: *******$123.4*******
  #
  # If the filler string is longer than one character, it is truncated to
  # the appropriate length. So:
  #   r.filler = '-->'
  #   print r.format("Pay bearer: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^", '$123.4')
  #   print r.format("Pay bearer: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^", '$13.4')
  #   print r.format("Pay bearer: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^", '$1.4')
  # prints:
  #   Pay bearer: -->-->-$123.4-->-->-
  #   Pay bearer: -->-->--$13.4-->-->-
  #   Pay bearer: -->-->--$1.4-->-->--
  #
  # If the value of the #filler option is a hash, then its +:left+ and
  # +:right+ entries specify separate filler strings for each side of an
  # interpolated value.
  #
  # == Options
  # The Perl variant supports option switching during processing of the
  # arguments of a single call to #format. This has been removed while
  # porting to Ruby, since I believe that this does not add to clarity
  # of code. So you have to change options explicitly.
  #
  # == Data argument types and handling
  # The +data+ part of the call to format can be either in String form, the
  # items being newline separated, or in Array form. The array form can
  # contain any kind of type you want, as long as it supports #to_s.
  #
  # So all of the following examples return the same result:
  #     # String form
  #   r.format("]]]].[[", "1234\n123")
  #     # Array form
  #   r.format("]]]].[[", [ 1234, 123 ])
  #     # Array with another type
  #   r.format("]]]].[[", [ 1234.0, 123.0 ])
  #
  # == Multi-line format specifiers and interleaving
  # By default, if a format specifier contains two or more lines (i.e. one
  # or more newline characters), the entire format specifier is repeatedly
  # filled as a unit, until all block fields have consumed their
  # corresponding arguments. For example, to build a simple look-up table:
  #   values = (1..12).to_a
  #   squares   = values.map { |el| sprintf "%.6g", el**2         }
  #   roots     = values.map { |el| sprintf "%.6g", Math.sqrt(el) }
  #   logs      = values.map { |el| sprintf "%.6g", Math.log(el)  }
  #   inverses  = values.map { |el| sprintf "%.6g", 1/el          }
  #
  #   puts reform.format(
  #     "  N      N**2    sqrt(N)      log(N)      1/N",
  #     "=====================================================",
  #     "| [[  |  [[[  |  [[[[[[[[[[ | [[[[[[[[[ | [[[[[[[[[ |" +
  #     "-----------------------------------------------------",
  #     values, squares, roots, logs, inverses
  #   )
  #
  # The multiline format specifier:
  #     "| [[  |  [[[  |  [[[[[[[[[[ | [[[[[[[[[ | [[[[[[[[[ |" +
  #     "-----------------------------------------------------"
  #
  # is treated as a single logical line. So #format alternately fills the
  # first physical line (interpolating one value from each of the arrays)
  # and the second physical line (which puts a line of dashes between each
  # row of the table) producing:
  #       N      N**2    sqrt(N)      log(N)      1/N

  #
  # This implies that formats and the variables from which they're filled
  # need to be interleaved. That is, a multi-line specification like this:
  #   puts r.format(
  #     "Passed:                      ##
  #        [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[             # single format specification
  #     Failed:                        # (needs two sets of data)
  #        [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[",          ##
  #     passes, fails)                ##  data for previous format
  # would print:
  #      Passed:
  #         <pass 1>
  #      Failed:
  #         <fail 1>
  #      Passed:
  #         <pass 2>
  #      Failed:
  #         <fail 2>
  #      Passed:
  #         <pass 3>
  #      Failed:
  #         <fail 3>
  #
  # because the four-line format specifier is treated as a single unit, to
  # be repeatedly filled until all the data in +passes+ and +fails+ has been
  # consumed.
  #
  # Unlike the table example, where this unit filling correctly put a line
  # of dashes between lines of data, in this case the alternation of passes
  # and fails is probably /not/ the desired effect.
  #
  # Judging by the labels, it is far more likely that the user wanted:
  #      Passed:
  #         <pass 1>
  #         <pass 2>
  #         <pass 3>
  #      Failed:
  #         <fail 4>
  #         <fail 5>
  #         <fail 6>
  #
  # To achieve that, either explicitly interleave the formats and their data
  # sources:
  #   puts r.format(
  #     "Passed:",               ## single format (no data required)
  #     "   [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[",    ## single format (needs one set of data)
  #         passes,              ## data for previous format
  #     "Failed:",               ## single format (no data required)
  #     "   [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[",    ## single format (needs one set of data)
  #         fails)               ## data for previous format
  # or instruct #format to do it for you automagically, by setting the
  # 'interleave' flag +true+:
  #
  #     r.interleave = true
  #     puts r.format(
  #       "Passed:                ##
  #        [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[         # single format
  #     Failed:                    # (needs two sets of data)
  #        [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[",      ##
  #                               ## data to be automagically interleaved
  #        passes, fails)          # as necessary between lines of previous
  #                               ## format
  #
  # == How #format hyphenates
  # Any line with a block field repeats on subsequent lines until all block
  # fields on that line have consumed all their data. Non-block fields on
  # these lines are replaced by the appropriate number of spaces.
  #
  # Words are wrapped whole, unless they will not fit into the field at all,
  # in which case they are broken and (by default) hyphenated. Simple
  # hyphenation is used (i.e. break at the +N-1+th character and insert a
  # '-'), unless a suitable alternative subroutine is specified instead.
  #
  # Words will not be broken if the break would leave less than 2 characters
  # on the current line. This minimum can be varied by setting the
  # +min_break+ option to a numeric value indicating the minumum total broken
  # characters (including hyphens) required on the current line. Note that,
  # for very narrow fields, words will still be broken (but
  # __unhyphenated__). For example:
  #
  #   puts r.format('~', 'split')
  #
  # would print:
  #
  #   s
  #   p
  #   l
  #   i
  #   t
  #
  # whilst:
  #
  #   r.min_break= 1
  #   puts r.format('~', 'split')
  #
  # would print:
  #
  #   s-
  #   p-
  #   l-
  #   i-
  #   t
  #
  # Alternative breaking strategies can be specified using the "break"
  # option in a configuration hash. For example:
  #
  #   r.break = MyBreaker.new
  #   r.format(fmt, data)
  #
  # #format expects a user-defined line-breaking strategy to listen to the
  # method #break that takes three arguments (the string to be broken, the
  # maximum permissible length of the initial section, and the total width
  # of the field being filled). #break must return a list of two strings:
  # the initial (broken) section of the word, and the remainder of the
  # string respectivly).
  #
  # For example:
  #   class MyBreaker
  #     def break(str, initial, total)
  #       [ str[0, initial-1].'~'], str[initial-1..-1] ]
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   r.break = MyBreaker.new
  #
  # makes '~' the hyphenation character, whilst:
  #   class WrapAndSlop
  #     def break(str, initial, total)
  #       if (initial == total)
  #         str =~ /\A(\s*\S*)(.*)/
  #         [ $1, $2 ]
  #       else
  #         [ '', str ]
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   r.break = WrapAndSlop.new
  #
  # wraps excessively long words to the next line and "slops" them over the
  # right margin if necessary.
  #
  # The Text::Reform class provides three functions to simplify the use of
  # variant hyphenation schemes. Text::Reform::break_wrap returns an
  # instance implementing the "wrap-and-slop" algorithm shown in the last
  # example, which could therefore be rewritten:
  #
  #   r.break = Text::Reform.break_wrap
  #
  # Text::Reform::break_with takes a single string argument and returns an
  # instance of a class which hyphenates by cutting off the text at the
  # right margin and appending the string argument. Hence the first of the
  # two examples could be rewritten:
  #
  #   r.break = Text::Reform.break_with('~')
  #
  # The method Text::Reform::break_at takes a single string argument and
  # returns a reference to a sub which hyphenates by breaking immediately
  # after that string. For example:
  #
  #   r.break = Text::Reform.break_at('-')
  #   r.format("[[[[[[[[[[[[[[", "The Newton-Raphson methodology")
  #
  # returns:
  #   "The Newton-
  #    Raphson
  #    methodology"
  #
  # Note that this differs from the behaviour of Text::Reform::break_with,
  # which would be:
  #
  #   r.break = Text::Reform.break_width('-')
  #   r.format("[[[[[[[[[[[[[[", "The Newton-Raphson methodology")
  #
  # returns:
  #       "The Newton-R-
  #        aphson metho-
  #        dology"
  #
  # Choosing the correct breaking strategy depends on your kind of data.
  #
  # The method Text::Reform::break_hyphen returns an instance of a class
  # which hyphenates using a Ruby hyphenator. The hyphenator must be
  # provided to the method. At the time of release, there are two
  # implementations of hyphenators available: TeX::Hyphen by Martin DeMello
  # and Austin Ziegler (a Ruby port of Jan Pazdziora's TeX::Hyphen module);
  # and Text::Hyphen by Austin Ziegler (a significant recoding of
  # TeX::Hyphen to better support non-English languages).
  #
  # For example:
  #   r.break = Text::Reform.break_hyphen
  #
  # Note that in the previous example the calls to .break_at, .break_wrap
  # and .break_hyphen produce instances of the corresponding strategy class.
  #
  # == The algorithm #format uses is:
  #
  # 1. If interleaving is specified, split the first string in the
  #    argument list into individual format lines and add a
  #    terminating newline (unless one is already present).
  #    therwise, treat the entire string as a single "line" (like
  #    /s does in regexes)
  #
  # 2. For each format line...
  #
  #    1. determine the number of fields and shift
  #       that many values off the argument list and
  #       into the filling list. If insufficient
  #       arguments are available, generate as many
  #       empty strings as are required.
  #
  #    2. generate a text line by filling each field
  #       in the format line with the initial contents
  #       of the corresponding arg in the filling list
  #       (and remove those initial contents from the arg).
  #
  #    3. replace any <,>, or ^ fields by an equivalent
  #       number of spaces. Splice out the corresponding
  #       args from the filling list.
  #
  #    4. Repeat from step 2.2 until all args in the
  #       filling list are empty.
  #
  # 3. concatenate the text lines generated in step 2
  #
  # Note that in difference to the Perl version of Text::Reform,
  # this version does not currently loop over several format strings
  # in one function call.

  #
  # == Reform#format examples
  #
  # As an example of the use of #format, the following:
  #
  #   count = 1
  #   text = "A big long piece of text to be formatted exquisitely"
  #   output = ''
  #   output << r.format("       ||||  <<<<<<<<<<   ", count, text)
  #   output << r.format("       ----------------   ",
  #                       "       ^^^^  ]]]]]]]]]]|  ", count+11, text)
  #
  # results in +output+:
  #           1    A big lon-
  #           ----------------
  #           12      g piece|
  #                   of text|
  #                to be for-|
  #                matted ex-|
  #                 quisitely|
  #
  # Note that block fields in a multi-line format string,
  # cause the entire multi-line format to be repeated as
  # often as necessary.
  #
  # Unlike traditional Perl #format arguments, picture strings and
  # arguments cannot be interleaved in Ruby version. This is partly
  # by intention to see if the feature is a feature or if it
  # can be disposed with. Another example:
  #
  #   report = ''
  #   report << r.format(
  #               'Name           Rank    Serial Number',
  #               '====           ====    =============',
  #               '<<<<<<<<<<<<<  ^^^^    <<<<<<<<<<<<<',
  #               name,           rank,   serial_number
  #            )
  #
  # results in:
  #
  #   Name           Rank    Serial Number
  #   ====           ====    =============
  #   John Doe       high    314159
  #
  # == Numerical formatting
  #
  # The ">>>.<<<" and "]]].[[[" field specifiers may be used to format
  # numeric values about a fixed decimal place marker. For example:
  #
  #   puts r.format('(]]]]].[[)', %w{
  #                1
  #                1.0
  #                1.001
  #                1.009
  #                123.456
  #                1234567
  #                one two
  #   })
  #
  # would print:
  #
  #   (   1.0)
  #   (   1.0)
  #   (   1.00)
  #   (   1.01)
  #   ( 123.46)
  #   (#####.##)
  #   (?????.??)
  #   (?????.??)
  #
  # Fractions are rounded to the specified number of places after the
  # decimal, but only significant digits are shown. That's why, in the
  # above example, 1 and 1.0 are formatted as "1.0", whilst 1.001 is
  # formatted as "1.00".
  #
  # You can specify that the maximal number of decimal places always be used
  # by giving the configuration option 'numeric' the value NUMBERS_ALL_PLACES.
  # For example:
  #
  #   r.numeric = Text::Reform::NUMBERS_ALL_PLACES
  #   puts r.format('(]]]]].[[)', <<EONUMS)
  #     1
  #     1.0
  #   EONUMS
  #
  # would print:
  #
  #   (   1.00)
  #   (   1.00)
  #
  # Note that although decimal digits are rounded to fit the specified width, the
  # integral part of a number is never modified. If there are not enough places
  # before the decimal place to represent the number, the entire number is
  # replaced with hashes.
  #
  # If a non-numeric sequence is passed as data for a numeric field, it is
  # formatted as a series of question marks. This querulous behaviour can be
  # changed by giving the configuration option 'numeric' a value that
  # matches /\bSkipNaN\b/i in which case, any invalid numeric data is simply
  # ignored. For example:
  #
  #
  #   r.numeric = Text::Reform::NUMBERS_SKIP_NAN
  #   puts r.format('(]]]]].[[)', %w{
  #                1
  #                two three
  #                4
  #   })
  #
  #
  # would print:
  #
  #   (   1.0)
  #   (   4.0)
  #
  # == Filling block fields with lists of values
  #
  # If an argument contains an array, then #format
  # automatically joins the elements of the array into a single string, separating
  # each element with a newline character. As a result, a call like this:
  #
  #   svalues = %w{ 1 10 100 1000 }
  #   nvalues = [1, 10, 100, 1000]
  #   puts r.format(
  #     "(]]]].[[)",
  #     svalues                         # you could also use nvalues here.
  #  )
  #
  # will print out
  #
  #       (  1.00)
  #       ( 10.00)
  #       (100.00)
  #       (1000.00)
  #
  # as might be expected.
  #
  # Note: While String arguments are consumed during formatting process
  # and will be empty at the end of formatting, array arguments are not.
  # So svalues (nvalues) still contains [1,10,100,1000] after the call
  # to #format.
  #
  # == Headers, footers, and pages
  #
  # The #format method can also insert headers, footers, and page-feeds
  # as it formats. These features are controlled by the "header", "footer",
  # "page_feed", "page_len", and "page_num" options.
  #
  # If the +page_num+ option is set to an Integer value, page numbering
  # will start at that value.
  #
  # The +page_len+ option specifies the total number of lines in a page (including
  # headers, footers, and page-feeds).
  #
  # The +page_width+ option specifies the total number of columns in a page.
  #
  # If the +header+ option is specified with a string value, that string is
  # used as the header of every page generated. If it is specified as a block,
  # that block is called at the start of every page and
  # its return value used as the header string. When called, the block is
  # passed the current page number.
  #
  # Likewise, if the +footer+ option is specified with a string value, that
  # string is used as the footer of every page generated. If it is specified
  # as a block, that block is called at the *start*
  # of every page and its return value used as the footer string. When called,
  # the footer block is passed the current page number.
  #
  # Both the header and footer options can also be specified as hash references.
  # In this case the hash entries for keys +left+, +centre+ (or +center+), and
  # +right+ specify what is to appear on the left, centre, and right of the
  # header/footer. The entry for the key +width+ specifies how wide the
  # footer is to be. If the +width+ key is omitted, the +page_width+ configuration
  # option (which defaults to 72 characters) is used.
  #
  # The  +:left+, +:centre+, and +:right+ values may be literal
  # strings, or blocks (just as a normal header/footer specification may
  # be.) See the second example, below.
  #
  # Another alternative for header and footer options is to specify them as a
  # block that returns a hash reference. The subroutine is called for each
  # page, then the resulting hash is treated like the hashes described in the
  # preceding paragraph. See the third example, below.
  #
  # The +page_feed+ option acts in exactly the same way, to produce a
  # page_feed which is appended after the footer. But note that the page_feed
  # is not counted as part of the page length.
  #
  # All three of these page components are recomputed at the *start of each
  # new page*, before the page contents are formatted (recomputing the header
  # and footer first makes it possible to determine how many lines of data to
  # format so as to adhere to the specified page length).
  #
  # When the call to #format is complete and the data has been fully formatted,
  # the footer subroutine is called one last time, with an extra argument of +true+.
  # The string returned by this final call is used as the final footer.
  #
  # So for example, a 60-line per page report, starting at page 7,
  # with appropriate headers and footers might be set up like so:
  #
  #   small = Text::Reform.new
  #   r.header = lambda do |page| "Page #{page}\n\n" end
  #   r.footer = lambda do |page, last|
  #     if last
  #       ''
  #     else
  #       ('-'*50 + "\n" + small.format('>'*50, "...#{page+1}"))
  #     end
  #   end
  #   r.page_feed = "\n\n"
  #   r.page_len = 60
  #   r.page_num = 7
  #
  #   r.format(template, data)
  #
  # Note that you can't reuse the +r+ instance of Text::Reform inside
  # the footer, it will end up calling itself recursivly until stack
  # exhaustion.
  #
  # Alternatively, to set up headers and footers such that the running
  # head is right justified in the header and the page number is centred
  # in the footer:
  #
  #   r.header = { :right => 'Running head' }
  #   r.footer = { :centre => lambda do |page| "page #{page}" end }
  #   r.page_len = 60
  #
  #   r.format(template, data)
  #
  # The footer in the previous example could also have been specified the other
  # way around, as a block that returns a hash (rather than a hash containing
  # a block):
  #
  #   r.header = { :right => 'Running head' }
  #   r.footer = lambda do |page| { :center => "page #{page}" } end
