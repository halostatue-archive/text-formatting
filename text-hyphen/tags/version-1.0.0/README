Text::Hyphen README
===================

Text::Hyphen will properly hyphenate various words according to the rules of
the language the word is written in. The algorithm is based on that of the TeX
typesetting system by Donald E. Knuth. This is originally based on the Perl
implementation of TeX::Hyphen[1] and the Ruby port TeX::Hyphen[2]. The
language hyphenation pattern files are based on the sources available from
CTAN[3] as of 2004.12.19 and have been translated by Austin Ziegler.

This release is 1.0, the initial release of Text::Hyphen, representing a
significant improvement over its predecessor, TeX::Hyphen.

    require 'text/hyphen'
    hh = Text::Hyphen.new(:language => 'en_us', :left => 2, :right => 2)
      # Defaults to the above
    hh = TeX::Hyphen.new
    
    word = "representation"
    points = hyp.hyphenate(word)  #=> [3, 5, 8, 10]
    puts hyp.visualize(word)      #=> rep-re-sen-ta-tion

Text::Hyphen is truly multilingual in nature[4]. As an example, consider the
difference between the following:

    require 'text/hyphen'
      # Using left and right minimum values of 0 ensures that you will see all
      # possible hyphenation points, not just those that meet the minimum
      # width requirements.
    en = Text::Hyphen.new(:left => 0, :right => 0)
    fr = Text::Hyphen.new(:language = "fr", :left => 0, :right => 0)

    puts en.visualise("organiser")      #=> or-gan-iser
    puts fr.visualise("organiser")      #=> or-ga-ni-ser

As you can see, the hyphenation is distinct between the two hyphenators.
Additional improvements over TeX::Hyphen include thread safety (except for
debug control) and support for UTF-8.

It is very important to read the LICENCE file and each language file desired,
as some languages may be held under a more strict licence than that granted by
LICENCE.
